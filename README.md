# HarBringer V2 

This is an Updated Python Trojan from the original Harbringer. 

## NOTICE!

This is for those people who didnt follow my guidelines and proceed to put the payloads generated by Harbringer into av's - namely VirusTotal. Due to this happening Harbringer is now openly detected hy windows defender, which means that most AV's are now likely to identifiy it. Stop putting payloads generated by Harbringer directly into AV's - mainly Virus Total. 

To proceed with usage of Harbringer, I would like to reccomend the usage of [Hyperion](https://github.com/billythegoat356/Hyperion) made by billythegoat356. I intend to create a intergration with his software, but for the time being - use his repo and obfuscate the python generate payloads, and then compile them into exe's manually.

If you would like to see the detection rate of the software and its paylaods, use either kleenscan or antiscan. If you wish to verify against specific AV's, use a vm and make sure YOU DO NOT HAVE AN INTERNECT CONNECTION when testing. Once your done testing DELETE THE VM!

## Notes: 

*This payload is designed for windows based systems only. Windows 10 and 11. Usage of this software is against the Discord ToS, using it may get you banned.*

## Functionality: 

Basically the original functionality, but with updates and a builder. 
Functions in no real order: 

* Upload everyfile from the victim's computer to a discord server. (Info Stealer)
* Sends screenshots of victims computer. (Spyware)
* Remote shutdown. 
* Keylogging (Spyware)
* System info: CPU, Memory info, Internect info. 
* Self-Destruct (works only when run as a python file - not when an exe). 
* File Encryption (Ransomware attack)
* Hunt specific files from a system and have them uploaded to a discord server. (Info Stealer)
* Persistence - adds itself to windows registry startup. 
* Maps System Directories

## Necessary things: 

To actually create the programs and files, there are a couple prequesites necessities which must be had.  
- Make sure you actually have python, if you dont - download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
- Clone the repo!
- Run the `module installer.py` file to download all of the necessary modules. 

## Post-Preperation: 

There are a Few things which must be done before the actual payloads can be made:
1. Activate developer mode on Discord: If you need help with this, go [here](https://beebom.com/how-enable-disable-developer-mode-discord/).
2. Make a new server (unless you want others to see the info) and copy the server ID. If you have actually truned on Discord Developer mode, you should be able to right click on the server icon and click on an item of the appearing in a drop down menue called 'copy server id'. Save the id to somewhere you can retrieve later. 
3. Create a Discord bot at the official Discord application maker portal: [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Once you have made a new bot, copy the bot token to a place where you can retrieve it later. Make Sure to enable the message prvillege intent setting. 
4. Now invite the bot into your server, make sure to invite it with admin privs.

## Preperation: 

1. Run the builder.py script. 
2. Do as the script asks you and give the bot token and server id where it asks. 
3. Select what you want as the scirpt prompts you, create an payload as an executable, installer etc. 

## Usage:

Once a victim has the payload installed on their system, you have these commands to use: 
* `/mass-upload` - starts uploading every viable file on a victims computer to the server. 
* `/screen-update` - sends screenshot of victims screen to the server
* `/quick-info` - gathers info based on ip-api
* `/shutdown` - shutsdown victims computer
* `/keylogger` - starts a keylogger
* `/hunt` - finds specified files you set and if found uploads them, ie: `/hunt example.docx`
* `/kill` - This is a broken feature as of now, I will be patching this. (It is meant to delete itself but it wont work)
* `/system-info` - Shows info about the victims pc.
* `/help` - Brings up a help menue with all the commands and their functions. 
* `/encrypt` - Encrypts a set path of your choosing with a password of your choosing, ie `/encrypt -p 1234 -f "C:\Users\James\Desktop"`
* `/decrypt` - Decrypts a set path you has set during encryption using a password you had set during encryption, ie `/decrypt -p 1234 -f "C:\Users\James\Desktop"`
* `/tree` - Maps system Directories of a given path, ie `/tree "C:\"`

## The Installer: 

I realised most people will be either afraid to use the installer as they think they will infect themselves or something along those lines. Let me explain what it is. The installer is a small file which can be used to install the final payload. This also means you can't infect yourself unless you run it, just like how running the software on yourself will infect your machine. I made it as the final payload is over 25mb, the max size for a lot of services, and sending it it would be difficult. As a way to get round this you can send the installer which wil just install the software once it has been run without a) contain the final package and b) being to big that you can't send it.
